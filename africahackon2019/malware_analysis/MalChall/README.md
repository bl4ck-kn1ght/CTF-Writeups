- I am locked. Do you have the key?
- We are given a [Zipfile](./MalChall.zip)

### Solution 
- Trying to unzip the zipfile asks for a password prompt
```bash
▶ unzip MalChall.zip 
Archive:  MalChall.zip
[MalChall.zip] MalChall/putty.exe password: 
```
- Lets try a bruteforce using rockyou.txt as our dictionary.
- You can write a script to do that, in our case We just used [fcrackzip]() to do bruteforce dictionary attack.
```bash
▶ fcrackzip -b -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -u MalChall.zip 
PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == bigboss
```
- Running this immeaditely founds the password, we submitted it as the flag and it worked. This was quite easy compared to the other challenges
- **FLAG** `AH{bigboss}`
